I conjecture that a graph structure over predictive model errors would help visualizing 2D scatterplot of embeddings.

Plus, you can compute graph algorithms on top of the structure (pagerank, etc.).

If you want to make something of this, go ahead and claim that its yours. I'm just here to experiment.
